* Understand the history of programming and the development of languages
* Interpret and develop specifications for programming languages
* Understand different models for programming and for associated languages
* Understand the relationship between system architectures and programming languages
* Understand the relationship between programming language features and how the language is translated
* Understand how language designers take different design approaches based on the language goals
* Gain practical experience with several new programming languages
* Be prepared to take CSCI 468, Compilers

### Instruction
Course schedule, lecture slides, and assignments are available through the course website.

### Grading Policy
Grades will be based on participation, six homeworks, four programming labs, a midterm exams, and a final exam. The couse will be broken down as follows:

### Attendance and Participation
Class attendance is mandatory and participation is highly encouraged. You are responsible for all the material covered in class. Prepare in advance for class by reading and styding the assigned material, and by making sure you unerstand the previous lecture. Thre will be six in-class Participation Excercises given on random dates throughout the semester. The lowest quiz score will be dropped and the remaining five scores will count towards 10\% of your course grade.

### Students with Disabilities
A student who desires accommodation for a disability must submit appropriate documentation of the disability and request for accommodations to The Office 
of Disability, Re-Entry, and Veteran's Services Room 155 Strand Union Building, (406) 994-2824.

### Academic Integrity
Honesty and integrity is expected in all class work. The standards set by Montana State Univerity's academic integrity and student conduct [guidelines](http://shiva.msu.montana.edu/courses/conduct.html) apply to this class. Academic misconduct is unacceptable. It is the responsibility of all students to adhere to strict standards of integrity in their professional and scholarly activities. Misconduct will be treated swiftly and harshly.

It is a breach of academic integrity to present the ideas or works of another as one's own work, or to permit another to present one's work without customary and proper acknowledgement of authorship. Students may collaborate with other students only as expressly permitted by the instructor. Students are responsible for the honest completion and representation of their work, the appropriate citation of sources and the respect and recognition of others' academic endeavors. According to Montana State University Conduct Guidelines and Grievance Procedures for STudents, academic misconduct includes cheating, plagiarism, forgery, facilitation or aiding academic dishonesty; multiple submission, theft of instructional materials or tests; unauthorized access to, manipulation of or tampering with laboratory equipment, experiments, or computer programs, without proper authorization; alteration of grades or files; misuse of research data in reporting results; use of personal relationships to gain grades or favors, or otherwise attempting to obtain grades or credit through fraudulent means.

### Policy on Cell Phones, Laptops, and Tablets
Bringing your personal phones, tables or laptops to class is fine. I do require that you set your phones to at least silent, and mute any sounds from either your tablet or laptop. Also refrain from replying or sending texts, social media, or phone calls during class, if you feel that you must do this then please leave the class and take care of it in the hallway. Further, playing games in class will also not be tolerated. The distractions that these actions cause both for your classmates as well as for your instructor are taxing on the limited time we have. If you are found to be performing any of these actions you will be asked to leave the classroom for the day.
