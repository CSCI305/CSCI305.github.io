### Code Examples

### Out of Class Exercise

#### Exercise 1
Write a function `red3` of type `'a * 'b * 'c -> 'a * 'b` that converts a tuple with three elements into one with two by eliminating the second element

#### Exercise 2
Write a function `sqsum` of type `int -> int` that takes a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of the squares of all the integers 0 through `n`. Your function need not behave well on inputs less than zero.

#### Exercise 3
Write a function `min3` of type `int * int * int -> int` that returns the smallest of three integers.

### In Class Exercises

#### Exercise 1
Write a function `cube` of type `int -> int` that returns the cube of its parameter.

#### Exercise 2
Write a function `isPrime` of type `int -> bool` that returns true if and only if its integer parameter is a prime number. Your function need not behave well if the parameter is negative.

#### Exercise 3
Write a function `pow` of type `real * int -> real` that raises a real number to an integer power. Your function need not behave well if the integer power is negative.

#### Exercise 4
Write a function `cycle1` of type `'a list * int -> 'a list` whose output is the same as the input list, but with the first element of the list moved to the end. For example `cycle1 [1,2,3,4]` should return `[2,3,4,1]`
