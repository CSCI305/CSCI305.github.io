### Out of Class Exercise

#### Exercise 1:
Write a function `max` of type `int list -> int` that returns the largest element of a list of integers. Your function need not behave well if the list is empty. *Hint:*  Write a helper function `maxhelper` that takes as a second parameter the largest element seen so far. Then you can complete the exercise by defining:

```ml
fun max x = maxhelper (tl x, hd x);
```

#### Exercise 2:
Write a function `fourth` of type `'a list -> 'a`  that returns the fourth element of a list. Your function need not behave well on lists with less than four elements.

### In Class Exercises

#### Exercise 1:
Write a function `curber` of type `real -> real` that returns the cube of its parameter

#### Exercise 2:
Write a function `thirds` of type `string -> char` that returns the third character of a string. Your function need not behave well on strings with lengths less than 3.

#### Exercise 3:
Write a function `del3` of type `'a list -> 'a list` whose output list is the same as the input list, but with the third element deleted. Your function need not behave well on lists with lengths less than 3.

#### Exercise 4:
Write a function `sort3` of type `real * real * real -> real list` that returns a list of three real numbers, in sorted order with the smallest first.
