### In Class Exercises
Define your answers to the following exercises in terms of the base relations `parent(X,Y)`, `female(X)`, and `male(X)`. To test your code, define some `parent` facts like those in the example code, along with appropriate `female` and `male` facts. But your solutions should be general enough to work with any set of such facts.

#### Exercise 1
Define a `mother` predicate so that `mother(X,Y)` says that `X` is the mother of `Y`.

##### Solution:

#### Exercise 2
Define a `father` predicate so that `father(X,Y)` says that `X` is the father of `Y`.

#### Check Your Learning:

##### Solution:

#### Exercise 3
Define a `sister` predicate so that `sister(X,Y)` says that `X` is the sister of `Y`. Be careful, a person cannot be her own sister.
