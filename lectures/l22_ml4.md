### Out of Class Exercise
#### Exercise 1
Write a `datatype` definition for a type `suit` whose values are the four suits of a deck of playing cards. Then using this definition, write a function `suitname` of type `suit -> string` that returns a string giving the name of a `suit`.

#### Exercise 2
Using the following definition of a `tree`. Write a function `isComplete` of type `'a tree -> bool` that tests whether a `tree` is complete. Note: a complete binary tree is one in which every `Node` has either two `Empty` children or two `Node` children, but not one of each.

```ml
datatype 'data tree =
   Empty |
   Node of 'data tree * 'data * 'data tree;
```

#### Check Your Learning:

##### Solution:
```ml
datatype 'data tree =
   Empty |
   Node of 'data tree * 'data * 'data tree;

fun isComplete Node(Empty _ Empty) = true
|   isComplete Empty = true
|   isComplete Node(x _ Empty) = false
|   isComplete Node(Empty _ x) = false
|   isComplete Node(left _ right) =
      isComplete left andalso isComplete right;
```

### In Class Exercises

#### Exercise 1
A Binary Search Tree is a binary tree with special properties. It may be `Empty`. It may be a `Node` containing a left subtree, a data item `x`, and a right subtree. In this case all the data items in the tree are different, all the items in the left subtree are smaller than `x`, all the items in the right subtree are greater than `x`, and the left and right subtrees are also binary search trees. Write a function `makeBST` of type `'a list -> ('a * 'a -> bool) -> 'a tree` that organizes the items in the list into a binary search tree. The tree need not be balanced. You may assume that no item in the list is repeated. You may want to start with the tree data type definition:

```ml
datatype 'data tree =
   Empty |
   Node of 'data tree * 'data * 'data tree;
```

<!--
##### Solution:
```ml
datatype 'data tree =
   Empty |
   Node of 'data tree * 'data * 'data tree;

fun makeBST [] op = Empty
|   makeBST x op =
      

``` -->

#### Exercise 2
Write a function `searchBST` of type `''a tree -> (''a * ''a -> bool) -> ''a -> bool` that searches a binary search tree for a given data element. You should not search every node in the tree, but only those nodes that, according to the definition, might contain the element you are looking for.
