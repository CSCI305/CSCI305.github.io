### Out of Class Exercises

#### Exercise 1
Write a function `il2rl` of type `int list -> real list` that takes a list of integers and returns a list of the same numbers converted to type `real`. For example, if you evaluate `il2rl [1,2,3]` you should get `[1.0,2.0,3.0]`

#### Check Your Learning:

##### Solution:
```ml
fun il2rl [] = []
|   il2rl (x::xs) = real(x) :: il2rl xs;
```

#### Exercise 2
Write a function `band` of type `bool list -> bool` that takes a list of boolean values and returns the logical AND of all of them. If the list is empty your function should return `true`

#### Check Your Learning:

##### Solution:
```ml
fun band [] = true
|   band (x::xs) =
      if not x then false
      else band(xs);
```

### In Class Exercises

#### Exercise 1
Write a function `ordList` of type `char list -> int list` that takes a list of characters and returns the list of the integer codes of those characters. For example, if you evaluate `ordList [#"A", #"b", #"C"]` you should get `[65, 98, 67]`.

#### Check Your Learning:
<!-- ```ml
fun ordList [] = []
|   ordList (x::xs) = ord(x) :: ordList xs;
``` -->

##### Solution:

#### Exercise 2
Write a function `sqsum` of type `int list -> int` that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of the squares of those integers. For example, if you evaluate `squm [1,2,3,4]` you should get `30`

#### Check Your Learning:

##### Solution:
<!-- ```ml
fun sqsum [] = 0
|   sqsum (x::xs) = (x * x) + sqsum(xs);
``` -->

#### Exercise 3
Write a function `append` of type `'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list` that takes two lists and returns the result of appending the second one onto the end of the first. For example, `append [1,2,3] [4,5,6]` should evaluate to `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`. Do not use the predefined appending utilities, like the @ operator or the `concat` function. Note that the function is curried.

#### Exercise 4:
Write a function `evens` of type `int list -> int list` that takes a list of integers and returns the list of all the even elements from the original list (in the original order). For example, if you evaluate `evens [1,2,3,4]` you should get `[2,4]`.
